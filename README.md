# Latent Semantic Analysis 



  Latent Sementic Analysis (LSA) is a theory and a natural language processing method which analyze relationships between a set of documents and the terms contained in the documents. A mathematical technique called "singular value decomposition (SVD)" is used to examinate the unstructured data to find hidden relationships between terms and concepts. More information about the LSA theory and the method can be found in a paper at the location: http://lsa.colorado.edu/papers/dp1.LSAintro.pdf.
  
  
  The Python code implemented in this repository is based on the LSA method. Given a set of text documents, the code can be used to find the correlations between words in these documents and the correlations between the documents in the set.
  
  
  There are 5 subdirectoies in this repository: source, input, output and scripts. Below are the description of each subdirectory:
  
  	source: has the source code in sequencial programming style
    
    source_OOP: has the source code in object orientied programing(OOP) style
  
  	input:  has the inputs data for the source code
  
  	output: has the outputs from the source code
  
  	scritps: has shell scripts to run the code
  
  The sample data used for the analysis are from the paper in the above link. Minimum 2 documents are required for analysis.
  
  Before running the code, 2 Python modules panda and sklearn need to be installed by doing the following:
  
  	pip install pandas
  	pip install sklearn
  
  Repl.it IDE (www.repl.it) has been used for code implementation and execution.
  
  
  To learn how to run the code, see script "runLSA.sh" or "runLSA_OOP.sh in scripts subdirectory.
